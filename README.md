## Install

> **WARNING :bangbang:** Make sure you know what you are doing and use at your own risk!

1. First, run `xcode-select --install` to enable Command Line Tools.

2. Next, run `softwareupdate --install-rosetta` to enable Rosetta 2.

3. Download and install [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases) and follow the post-installation instructions.

4. Next, clone this repo. [^git_sm_tip1] Command Line Tools should install `git`, so we should be fine.

   [^git_sm_tip1]: How to update (or pull) submodules in a git repo? *Answered by @ElectricRCAircraftGuy*. See https://stackoverflow.com/a/74470585 (StackOverflow)

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive \
             --depth=1 \
             https://github.com/kosperera/dotfiles \
             ~/.dotfiles
             
   # Pull submodules.
   git submodule update --recursive --remote
   ```

5. Then, run `source ~/.dotfiles/update-os-settings` to make macOS and Terminal.app to be smarter.

6. Next, run `source ~/.dotfiles/install` to install nerd fonts, dev tools, cli tools, sdks, apps and the like.

   > SDKMAN install script tweaks our `.zshrc` file but those `export` commands are already done in the `.zshrc`, so we can disregard those changes.

7. Import Terminal.app theme from [/terminals](/terminals) folder, then change font to *JetBrains Mono Nerd Font 12pt*.

8. Restart the Terminal.app to [install and setup cli tools](.zshrc). Some of these changes require a logout/restart to take effect.
